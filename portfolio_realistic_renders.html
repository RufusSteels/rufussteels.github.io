                        I have a friend who recently bought an apartment and is going to renovate. 
                        For helping him make a choice on materials and colors I decided to try my hand at recreating the apartment in Unity. 
                        I started by blocking out the basic shape of the apartment.
                    </p>

                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        Afterwards, when I had a simple scene to work with I started working on some shaders.<br>
                        Because I wanted to be able to change as much as possible with as little effort as possible, 
                        I decided to calculate everything in the shader itself, meaning I did not need to download or generate textures, 
                        since the shaders would use built in noise textures and math to show a material.
                    </p>

                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        After creating some shaders and placing them on the meshes I needed to have some nice lighting in the scene.<br>
                        I used my prior knowledge and some researching skills to bake some lighting and tweak some settings until I was satisfied.
                    </p>

                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        Now I could play around with some sliders to change the look of the materials so my friend could make some informed decisions!

                        But I wasn't quite finished yet, the apartment is still looking kind of empty. And one way to change that: furniture!<br>
                        There's still some extra props to be added though...
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        And since I was in this deep already and wanted to have something as realistic as possible, 
                        I also added some reflection probes to get some realistic looking reflections. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 aside">
                    <img class="article-visual" src="Images/Realistic_Renders/Realistic_Renders_09.png" alt="Living Room">

                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        Now I know this isn't the most realistic looking render out there, 
                        partially due to it being rendered in real time and partially because I still need some practise with the modular shaders. 
                        But it is a good exercise. 
                        And I am also not done with this project yet, 
                        I would like to furnish it entirely, and create some more shaders, 
                        or tweak some to make them look even better
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        Every prop or object in the scene is created without external textures, 
                        this is a nice exercise and an extra challenge for me to make objects look as real as possible and still be very modular.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since I am used to programming in Unity, 
                        I also wrote a small first person player controller script (and a few others) to be able to walk around in the apartment.<br><br>
