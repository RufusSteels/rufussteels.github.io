                    <h2>A bit about me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Rufus Steels. <br><br>

                        â€‹I graduated at Howest - University of Applied Sciences in 2023 majoring in Independent Game Production.<br><br>

                        I picked this major because I am interested in several aspects of the game production process. 
                        My liking for programming stems from my younger years, but in my previous studies this liking grew into a passion. 
                        I have always liked drawing and making new or cool looking things.
                        The combination of these topics meant that independent game development was not a hard choice for me to make.<br><br>

                        Of course, like most other game dev's, I don't just like making games but I also like playing them. 
                        Ever since I was a little boy gaming has been a part of my life. 
                        Either in the form of single-player games, multiplayer games, and last but definitely not least... board games. <br><br>
                        
                        Aside from gaming and computers, I also like music... generic right? Well, yeah I guess. 
                        Music's great and even though I don't do it nearly enough, jamming to a real banger on the drums is pretty great too. <br><br>
                        
                        As I have mentioned above I have already graduated in another sector. 
                        I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics/ICT. 
                        This is where I learned the basics of programming and also how software and hardware are connected. 
                        This is one of the many random topics that for some reason I find very fascinating. <br><br>
                        
                        Currently I am also employed in this industry as an embedded software engineer. <br><br>
                        
                        So that's me in a nutshell. 
                        And even though you can't say everything about yourself in just a couple of lines I'd say now you have a bit of an idea about who I am.
