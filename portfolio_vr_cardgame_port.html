                        For my internship I was tasked with porting a card game app to a completely new medium, VR.<br>

                        At first The question was: "What makes A VR game fun, and how can I implement this into a card game". 
                        So of course the first step in answering this question was to make a prototype. <br>

                        This prototype served the purpose of answering these question and as well as being perfect practise for learning how to develop VR Game in Unity.

            </div>

            <div class="flex-container">

                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        After the prototype was finished, I started implementing the card game.<br>

                        The app had been in development for a couple of years, which means that there was an entire framework in place I had to plug into. 
                        This was one of the more difficult parts of the internship, but also one of the most educational. 
                        I learned a lot about the process of porting and also came into contact with some new programming techniques.
                    </p>

            </div>

            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        What the most important part of this internship was to have the logic that was already present in the app made it into VR.<br>

                        So after some time developing the company had a way to play their game in Virtual Reality.

            <div class="flex-container">

                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        Now all that needed to be done was to make it look pretty and add some more features. 
                        Some modelling, light baking, texturing and coding later This was the result. 
                        Of course some textures have been altered a bit to remove some of the branding just to be on the safe side.

                    <p>
                        Some small extra's were also added to make it feel more like a cool VR experience where you can interact more with the world.<br>

                        One example of this is the ability to play darts as well.<br>

                        because, you know, throwing stuff in VR is a lot of fun.

                <div class="flex-item flex-item-2 main">
                    <p>
                        Another fun experiment was the hand tracking. 
                        It really does feel cool to be able to see your hands do what your actual hands do when you are in a virtual world.
